# Summary

For my project, I will be creating a traveling system for traveling. The way I did this was by creating a graph that had different locations for people to travel to. The program would provide the distance in miles as well as the cost for the flight. In the end it would give you a sum of how many miles you traveled and how much it cost in total.

# How To Run

In order to run this, you just need to make sure that the files are all in the same directory. The Main.cpp file runs the program.

# Dependencies

Should compile with C++11. Should not need a third party library. 

# System Requirements

On a linux or Unix machine, this should be able to run through the terminal. The program should run on any machine as long as it has the GCC compiler.

# Dawud_CSCI2270_FinalProject

# For my project, I will be creating a traveling system for flights. The way that I plan on doing this is by creating a binary search tree of different cities and either their distance from certain cities or by price. We will incorporate a grid where the user will be able to select a city that they would like to go to and find the shortest connection paths to that location or by finding the cheapest path to take to save the most money.
